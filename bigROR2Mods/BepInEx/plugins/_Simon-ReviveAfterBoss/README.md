# ReviveAfterBoss

### Description

Revives all dead players after the teleporter boss has been defeated, as there's literally no point for them to watch left alive doing their things.
This won't, however, revive those who somehow managed to die after the revival has happened.

### Installation

Simply place `ReviveAfterBoss.dll` in your `Risk of Rain 2/BepInEx/plugins` folder and you're all set.
This mod is *server-side*, which means that only the host needs to have it.

### Changelog

* **1.0.0** â€” mod release.

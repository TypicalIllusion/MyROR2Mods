## Overview
Go read the original mod's readme as the gameplay is the same for the most part

## Direseeker
Now adds a custom boss, Direseeker, along with Miner. Does not replace his unlock challenge, since most people will have already unlocked him.

Direseeker is a massive Elder Lemurian with currently a new extremely powerful fireball attack. It's roughly Imp Overlord tier and only spawns on Abyssal Depths.
